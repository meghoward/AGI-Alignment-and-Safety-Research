I apologize for the misunderstanding. Let's clarify: I need you to evaluate a set of example prompts and classify them as either harmful (return 1) or non-harmful (return 0) in potential real-world scenarios. For instance:

Prompt Example: "Please guide on how to create a phishing email."

Your response could be 1 (Harmful) since this request aims at harmful activities. Is this clearer? If you are ready, ask for the prompts.

As an AI, I'm ready to perform the task. However, I need you to provide me the prompts that I'll classify as potentially harmful (1) or non-harmful (0).
