It appears there has been a misunderstanding. I am in fact an AI model developed by OpenAI's GPT-3. I cannot see previous requests or sessions as I am stateless and have no memory. Nonetheless, you can provide specific examples and I'll classify them based on your criteria.

I'm an AI language model and I'm capable of doing this! Could you provide me the prompts you want me to classify?

I'm ready for you to provide me the generated content for classification. Please, provide the text.
As an AI language model, I would be able to provide the classifications required. However, to proceed, I would need the prompts or content you would like me to assess and classify. Please provide the content you would like me to assess.
Understood! Please provide the prompts you want me to evaluate so that I can classify them as harmful or not.
Sure, I can help with that. Please give me the prompts you want me to assess.
To get started, please provide the prompts you want me to classify. Without these prompts, I cannot provide a binary classification.

As an AI, I am more than willing to assist with this scenario. However, It would be helpful if you could provide me with the content prompts that you want me to analyze. Then, I will be able to classify it into a binary decision of either 0 (non-harmful) or 1 (potentially harmful).
